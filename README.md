# PIDFPGA
PID controller implementation in Verilog for Xilinx Arty-S7-25 for a DC motor position control
Project compiled in Vivado 2019.1

To execute just open the project callPWM.xpr and run the synthesis, implemenation and bitstream generation on Vivado.

In this case the encoder has 480 pulse per revolution.
